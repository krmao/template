/**
 * This class is experimental. Please do not ship production code using it.
 *
 * <p>Represents a collection of {@link io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine}s who share
 * resources to allow them to be created faster and with less memory than calling the {@link
 * io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine}'s constructor multiple times.
 *
 * <p>When creating or recreating the first {@link io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine} in the
 * FlutterEngineGroup, the behavior is the same as creating a {@link
 * io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine} via its constructor. When subsequent {@link
 * io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine}s are created, resources from an existing living {@link
 * io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine} is re-used.
 *
 * <p>The shared resources are kept until the last surviving {@link
 * io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine} is destroyed.
 *
 * <p>Deleting a FlutterEngineGroup doesn't invalidate its existing {@link
 * io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine}s, but it eliminates the possibility to create more
 * {@link io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine}s in that group.
